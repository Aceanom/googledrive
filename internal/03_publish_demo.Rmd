This is a little demo to show how we can check if a file is published & publish it if we so desire.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library('dplyr')
library('googledrive')
```

```{r}
write.table("This is a little demo", "demo.txt")
gd_upload("demo.txt", name = "Happy Little Demo")
```

```{r}
my_file <- gd_get_id("Happy Little Demo") %>%
  gd_file
```

## check published status

```{r}
my_file %>%
  gd_check_publish
```
the `gd_check_publish` also outputs a new file with a tibble called `publish` with publication information. We can overwrite `my_file` to see this
```{r}
my_file <- my_file %>%
  gd_check_publish
```

```{r}
my_file$publish
```

## publish it
```{r}
my_file <- my_file %>%
  gd_publish
```

now we have tibble with publication status

```{r}
my_file$publish
```

## clean up

```{r}
gd_delete(my_file)
```

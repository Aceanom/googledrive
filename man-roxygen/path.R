#' @param path Drive File, something that identifies where the file should live
#'   on your Google Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked
#'   with \code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If specified as an
#'   actual path, you can include the name, indicated by not appending a final
#'   slash (i.e.: "abc/def" would indicate the file will be named "def" and placed
#'   in "abc", where as "abc/def/" indicates the file will be placed in folder "def"
#'   which is located in folder "abc"), or you can specify the name with the
#'   \code{name} parameter.

This will go over all the ways to identify Drive files with googledrive:

  * `drive_search()`: Similar to what you can do at <https://drive.google.com>
  * `drive_path()` and `drive_paths()`: Identify files by name or, more generally, path
  * `drive_get()`: Identify files by their ID
  * `drive_ls()`: List the contents of a folder on Drive
